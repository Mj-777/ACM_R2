# ACM_R2
HI THIS IS JUHI. SO MY VERTICAL IS AI/ML.
I WANT TO GO INTO DEEP LEARNING
MY SELECTED PATHWAY WAS DOING A PYTHON COURSE ON KAGGLE AND THEN DOING THAT fast.ai COURSE IN THE RESOURCES. SO FAR I HAVE LEARNT PYTHON (FROM THAT KAGGLE MODULE) BUT IT DEFINITELY TOOK MORE THAN 5 HOURS. ALSO I GOT SICK IN THE MIDDLE WHICH IS NOT EVEN AN EXCUSE CAUSE LITERALLY HALF OF THE CAMPUS WAS SICK. I HAVE LINKED MY KAGGLE TO GITHUB BUT I DONT KNOW IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE IT. ASLO I DONT KNOW IF I WOULD MAKE IT TO ACM, BUT THANK YOU TO YOU GUYS, FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD THE COURAGE TO LEARN A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. I AM FROM PHARMACY, AND ONE OF THE FIRST MODELS I WOULD WANT TO WORK ON IS 'PREDICTING DRUG COMBINATIONS FOR A SET OF PATIENTS USING MACHINE LEARNING' HOPE YOU DONT KICK US OUT OF THE DISCORD SERVER IF DONT MAKE IT, CAUSE THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL.
THANK YOU
