HI THIS IS JUHI. SO MY VERTICAL IS AI/ML.
I WANT TO GO INTO DEEP LEARNING
MY SELECTED PATHWAY WAS DOING A PYTHON COURSE ON KAGGLE AND THEN DOING THAT fast.ai COURSE IN THE RESOURCES. SO FAR I HAVE LEARNT PYTHON (FROM THAT KAGGLE MODULE) BUT IT DEFINITELY TOOK MORE THAN 5 HOURS. ALSO I GOT SICK IN THE MIDDLE WHICH IS NOT EVEN AN EXCUSE CAUSE LITERALLY HALF OF THE CAMPUS WAS SICK. I HAVE LINKED MY KAGGLE TO GITHUB BUT I DONT KNOW IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE IT.
